# Wiring guide (bench build)

Written for someone who is not a wiring person. Every connection is listed pin by pin. Do the steps in order and do not skip the checks; the panel is the expensive part and the backlight is the one thing that can cook it.

## What you are building

Same thing as text, for when the picture is too small on a phone:

```

Three groups of wires:
1. **Power**: 12 V to the Pololu and the PT4115; 5 V from the Pololu to the P4-NANO; 3.3 V from the P4-NANO to the panel; one shared ground.
2. **Control**: panel RESET from GPIO27, PT4115 DIM from GPIO26, panel STBYB tied to 3.3 V.
3. **Video**: six MIPI wires (three pairs) from the P4-NANO's DSI connector to the panel. These are the only fussy ones.

## Tools

Multimeter, small flat screwdriver for the terminal blocks, wire strippers, a pack of female-female Dupont jumpers (100 mm), tweezers for the FPC latches, a 12 V 2 A supply.

## Step 0. Board alone, no panel (Stage 0 in software.md)

1. Plug the P4-NANO into the PC over USB-C. Nothing else connected.
2. Flash `esphome/bike-dash-p4nano.yaml` with the `display:` block commented out.
3. Confirm the log shows the C6 radio coming up and Wi-Fi connecting. If this does not work, nothing else matters yet.

## Step 1. Check the PT4115 module before it ever touches the panel

The module sets its current with a resistor marked something like `R100`, `R150`, `R200`, `R330`, `R390`. Find it (a small black rectangle next to the big chip). Current = 0.1 V / resistance:

| Marking | Ohms | Current | OK for this panel? |
|---|---|---|---|
| R330 | 0.33 | 300 mA | Yes (max is 315) |
| R390 | 0.39 | 256 mA | Yes (a touch dim, fine) |
| R100 | 0.10 | 1000 mA | **NO. Will destroy the backlight.** |
| R150 / R200 | 0.15 / 0.20 | 670 / 500 mA | **NO** |

If all three modules are above 315 mA, do not use them. Buy a module marked R330/R390, or replace the resistor. Do not guess.

Then test the driver on its own: connect 12 V to Vin+/Vin-, put the multimeter on the **LED output in current mode (mA)** between LED+ and LED-. It should read roughly the number in the table. Disconnect.

## Step 2. Power wiring

All terminal blocks: strip 6 mm, insert, tighten, tug-test.

| From | To | Wire |
|---|---|---|
| 12 V supply + | Pololu **VIN** | red |
| 12 V supply - | Pololu **GND** | black |
| 12 V supply + | PT4115 **VIN+** (or "IN+") | red |
| 12 V supply - | PT4115 **VIN-** (or "IN-") | black |
| Pololu **VOUT** (5 V) | P4-NANO header pin labelled **5V** | red |
| Pololu **GND** | P4-NANO header pin labelled **GND** | black |

Check with the meter before going on: Pololu VOUT to GND reads **4.9-5.1 V**. If it reads 12 V you wired VIN and VOUT backwards. Power off.

On the bench you can skip the Pololu and just use USB-C for the P4-NANO. You still need 12 V for the PT4115.

## Step 3. Panel side: the 40-pin breakout

1. Open the black latch on the 40-pin breakout's FPC socket (flip up or slide out, depending on the model).
2. Slide the panel's tail in **contacts facing the contacts in the socket**. The Riverdi tail has contacts on one side only; if the picture stays dead later, this is the first thing to flip.
3. Close the latch. Pin 1 of the tail is marked on the panel's drawing; the breakout has "1" printed at one end. Make sure they line up, or every pin below is off by one.

Now wire the breakout's header pins. Pin numbers are the **panel** pin numbers (they match the breakout's printed numbers when pin 1 lines up):

| Breakout pin | Panel signal | Goes to | Wire |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 **and** 3 | VDD 3.3 V | P4-NANO header **3V3** (use one jumper to pin 2 and a second from pin 2 to pin 3, or a Y) | red |
| 5 | RESET | P4-NANO header **GPIO27** | yellow |
| 6 | STBYB | P4-NANO header **3V3** (same 3.3 V as above) | red |
| 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 | GND | P4-NANO header **GND** (at least two of them; the more the better) | black |
| 31 **and** 32 | LED- | PT4115 **LED-** | black |
| 39 **and** 40 | LED+ | PT4115 **LED+** | red |
| 8 | D0N | 22-pin breakout, DSI **D0-** (Step 4) | pair 1 |
| 9 | D0P | 22-pin breakout, DSI **D0+** | pair 1 |
| 11 | D1N | 22-pin breakout, DSI **D1-** | pair 2 |
| 12 | D1P | 22-pin breakout, DSI **D1+** | pair 2 |
| 17 | DCLKN | 22-pin breakout, DSI **CLK-** | pair 3 |
| 18 | DCLKP | 22-pin breakout, DSI **CLK+** | pair 3 |
| 1, 4, 14, 15, 20, 21, 33-38 | NC / lanes 2-3 | **nothing** | |
| 22-30 | GND / NC / scan direction | leave as the datasheet table says (GND pins to GND, NC open). If the image comes up mirrored later, the U/D and L/R pins here flip it. | |

PT4115 DIM: one jumper from PT4115 **DIM** (may be labelled PWM) to P4-NANO header **GPIO26**.

## Step 4. Video side: the 22-pin breakout on the P4-NANO

The P4-NANO's DSI socket is a 22-pin 0.5 mm FPC. A 22-pin FFC cable goes from the NANO to the 22-pin breakout; then six jumpers go from the breakout to the 40-pin breakout (table in Step 3).

**Which of the 22 pins are which has to be confirmed from the P4-NANO schematic when the board arrives**, because Waveshare's PDF does not have a text table. Schematic: https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-P4-NANO/ESP32-P4-NANO-schematic.pdf , find the DSI connector symbol; its nets are `DSI_D0_N`, `DSI_D0_P`, `DSI_D1_N`, `DSI_D1_P`, `DSI_CLK_N`, `DSI_CLK_P`, plus `GPIO7`, `GPIO8`, `GPIO37`, `GPIO38`, 3V3 and GND. Write the pin numbers into the table below and commit it.

Expected layout (the Raspberry Pi 22-pin DSI order that Waveshare's own DSI panels use; **confirm before wiring**):

| 22-pin pin | Expected signal | Confirmed? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GND | |
| 2 | DSI D0- | |
| 3 | DSI D0+ | |
| 4 | GND | |
| 5 | DSI D1- | |
| 6 | DSI D1+ | |
| 7 | GND | |
| 8 | DSI CLK- | |
| 9 | DSI CLK+ | |
| 10 | GND | |
| 11-16 | lanes 2/3 on a 4-lane host, unused here | |
| 17-22 | I2C, GPIO37/38, 3V3 | not used by this build |

How to confirm with a meter (board powered **off**): continuity from a 22-pin breakout pin to a GND header pin tells you which pins are ground; the pairs sit between the grounds. That alone fixes pins 1-10 to the pattern above. Which of each pair is + and - cannot be measured; take it from the schematic. If you get a pair swapped the picture will not come up at all, so swapping the two wires of one pair is a legitimate troubleshooting step.

Rules for the six video jumpers:
- Same length, as short as you can (100 mm max on the bench).
- Keep each pair's two wires twisted together or taped side by side.
- Do not run them next to the 12 V wires.

## Step 4b. GPS (speed source)

The P4-NANO has no dedicated GPS header; any two free header GPIOs become a UART. The config uses **GPIO24 = P4 TX, GPIO25 = P4 RX** (change the `gps_tx_pin` / `gps_rx_pin` substitutions if those are taken on the silkscreen).

Four wires. TX goes to RX and RX goes to TX; that is the one everybody gets backwards.

| GPS pin (SparkFun NEO-M9N) | Goes to | Wire |
|---|---|---|
| **3V3** | P4-NANO header **3V3**. **Not 5V: this board is 3.3 V only and 5 V will kill it.** | red |
| GND | P4-NANO header **GND** | black |
| TX (GPS talks) | P4-NANO header **GPIO25** (P4 RX) | green |
| RX (GPS listens) | P4-NANO header **GPIO24** (P4 TX) | white |

(If the Matek M9N-5883 was bought instead: its 5V pin goes to the header **5V**, and its RX/TX pins wire the same way. Its UART is 3.3 V logic too.)

No level shifting needed either way. Keep the antenna (the square ceramic patch) facing the sky with nothing metal on top of it; on the bike that means the top of the enclosure, not under the panel.

### One-time GPS setup (do this on the PC before wiring it to the P4)

Factory default is 1 update per second at 9600 baud, which makes a laggy speedo. We want 10 per second at 115200.

1. Connect the GPS to the USB-TTL adapter with the adapter's switch on **3.3 V**: 3V3-3V3, GND-GND, GPS TX to adapter RX, GPS RX to adapter TX. (If the SparkFun board's USB-C port shows up as a COM port on the PC, use that instead and skip the adapter.)
2. Install u-blox **u-center** (free, Windows). Connect at 9600 (Matek: 38400).
3. View > Messages View > UBX > CFG > RATE: set Measurement Period **100 ms**, click Send.
4. UBX > CFG > PRT: UART1, baud **115200**, Send. Reconnect u-center at 115200.
5. UBX > CFG > CFG: tick "Save current configuration", all devices (BBR + Flash if offered), Send.
6. Power-cycle the module and reconnect at 115200. If it is still at 10 Hz / 115200, done. If it forgot, the module has no flash or battery for settings: uncomment the `on_boot` block in the YAML, which re-sends the same settings every time the dash powers up.

The three UBX command strings the `on_boot` block sends (widely used values, verify against u-center's "Send" hex dump if in doubt):

| Purpose | Bytes |
|---|---|
| 10 Hz (CFG-RATE 100 ms) | `B5 62 06 08 06 00 64 00 01 00 01 00 7A 12` |
| 115200 baud (CFG-PRT UART1) | `B5 62 06 00 14 00 01 00 00 00 D0 08 00 00 00 C2 01 00 07 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 C0 7E` |
| Save (CFG-CFG) | `B5 62 06 09 0D 00 00 00 00 00 FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 17 31 BF` |

Test: with the dash running, the log prints satellites, speed and course from the `gps:` component. Outdoors it needs 30-90 s for a first fix; indoors near a window maybe, in a basement never.

## Step 5. Power-on order and first test

1. Meter check, power off: panel pin 2 to any GND must **not** be a short. Panel pin 39 to pin 31 must not be a short.
2. Power the 12 V supply. PT4115 LED output is now live but nothing is drawn yet (it is fine; it is a current source, open circuit is safe).
3. Plug USB-C into the P4-NANO (or turn on the Pololu 5 V).
4. Flash the config **with** the `display:` block. Expect: backlight comes on (Stage 1), screen shows green with a grey box.

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Backlight off | GPIO26 jumper; DIM floating should mean full on, so if it is still off the PT4115 has no 12 V or LED+/- are swapped |
| Backlight on, screen black, no errors in the log | Reset wire (GPIO27 to pin 5); STBYB tied to 3.3 V; panel tail inserted contacts-down vs contacts-up; THS_ZERO note in hardware.md |
| Log shows DSI errors | A pair swapped, or a pair to the wrong lane; try swapping + and - of one pair, then lanes 0 and 1 |
| Scrambled or rolling picture | `lane_bit_rate` (try 800 or 1000 Mbps), then `pclk_frequency` |
| Picture mirrored | scan-direction pins 22-30 on the panel |
| Panel gets hot | stop; check the PT4115 current (Step 1) |

## Step 6. Bike install (later)

Same connections, but: the two breakouts and jumpers become a carrier PCB, the 12 V comes from a fused ignition-switched feed, the Pololu EN pin follows the ignition, and everything lives in the enclosure with the panel. Do not put jumper wires on a motorcycle.

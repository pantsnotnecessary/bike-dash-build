### Init sequence (datasheet p.16). This is what goes in the ESPHome `init_sequence`

```
0x01            ; DCS software reset
delay 120 ms
0xB2 0x50       ; lanes: 0x50 = 2-lane, 0x60 = 3, 0x70 = 4   <-- P4 uses 2
0x80 0x4B       ; gamma
0x81 0xFF
0x82 0x1A
0x83 0x88
0x84 0x8F
0x85 0x35
0x86 0xB0

### Timing (datasheet, typical / range)

| Parameter | Typ | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Pixel clock | 51.2 MHz | 44.9-63 MHz |
| H active | 1024 | |
| HSYNC pulse | 70 | 1-140 |
| H back porch | 160 | fixed |
| H front porch | 160 | 16-216 |
| V active | 600 | |
| VSYNC pulse | 10 | 1-20 |
| V back porch | 23 | fixed |
| V front porch | 12 | 1-127 |

### Gotchas from the datasheet

- **THS_ZERO**: the panel's MIPI receiver does not meet the MIPI minimum. If the host's THS_ZERO sits at the low end the panel silently fails to init. If the screen stays black with a good init log, this is the first thing to look at (ESP-IDF DSI PHY timing).
- The Waveshare 7B ESPHome preset for the same panel class uses `lane_bit_rate: 900Mbps`, `pclk 52MHz`, hsync 10/160/160, vsync 1/23/12. Good starting point.

## Waveshare ESP32-P4-NANO

Wiki: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-P4-Nano-StartPage . Schematic: https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-P4-NANO/ESP32-P4-NANO-schematic.pdf

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| SoC | ESP32-P4NRW32, 32 MB PSRAM in package, 16 MB QSPI flash |
| Radio | ESP32-C6-MINI-1 over SDIO: reset GPIO54, cmd 19, clk 18, d0-d3 = 14-17, active high (ESPHome device page) |
| I2C | SDA GPIO7, SCL GPIO8 (also on the DSI connector) |
| LCD reset (BSP default) | GPIO27 on the GPIO header |
| LCD backlight PWM (BSP default) | GPIO26 on the GPIO header |
| DSI | 22-pin 0.5 mm FPC, 2 lanes + clock. The schematic also routes GPIO37, GPIO38, SDA/SCL and 3.3 V to it. We only use the six MIPI signals and ground from this connector; reset and backlight go from the header instead. |
| Power | USB-C, or 5 V on the header, or PoE module |
| Storage | microSD, SDIO 3.0 |
| ESPHome presets that exist for this board | `WAVESHARE-P4-NANO-10.1` (their 10.1" DSI panel); copy only the board-level bits |

## PT4115 backlight driver module

- Buck topology: Vin must be above the LED string (9.6 V) plus about 1 V. 12 V is fine. 5 V is not.
- Output current is fixed by the module's sense resistor: **I = 0.1 V / Rs**. Target 270 mA, so Rs about 0.37 ohm. 0.33 ohm gives about 300 mA (under the 315 mA max), 0.39 ohm gives about 256 mA. **Read the resistor on the module before connecting the panel** (see wiring.md step 3). Three modules were bought so one can be modified.
- DIM pin: PWM 100 Hz-20 kHz from a P4 GPIO, 3.3 V logic is enough. Left floating = full on. Use about 5 kHz so it is not visible.

## Pololu D36V28F5

5.3-50 V in, 5 V 3.2 A out, reverse-polarity protected, has an EN pin (tie to ignition-switched 12 V if we want the dash off with the key without a relay).

## On-bike carrier PCB (later)

Replace both breakouts and the jumpers with one board: 22-pin FPC in, 40-pin FPC out, DSI pairs as 100 ohm differential traces, PT4115 + Pololu footprints (or discrete equivalents), fuse, ignition-sense input. Design it only after the bench build shows the panel initialising.

## Antennas

None to buy for the bench. All radios have on-board antennas; the rules for the bike install:

| Radio | Rule |
|---|---|
| BLE, C6 on the P4-NANO (PCB antenna) | Plastic enclosure. Keep the NANO away from the panel's driver strip and the MIPI wires; the e-paper gauge showed display electronics desensing the radio. |
| GPS, SparkFun chip antenna | Must see sky: top of the enclosure, plastic lid, nothing metal above it. If first fix is slow or speed drops out, swap to the SparkFun NEO-M9N u.FL version plus a small active patch antenna (about $12) mounted outside. |
| XIAO C6 (contingency) | Same as BLE; it has a u.FL socket if an external antenna is ever needed. |
| Metal enclosure | Do not. Everything would need external antennas. |
